## wlh-dotfiles
my dotfiles backup

Modified from some dotfiles I like. :)

I use both KDE and i3wm. (Now I mainly use KDE instead, but dotfiles about i3wm still works).

I hope it can help someone who would like to try i3wm.

### Dependencies
- i3-gaps
- conky
- compton
- ttf-font-awesome

You need to install these packages to make my i3 dotfile work.

Hope you like it.

### Update 2017.12
I use KDE now and I will switch to i3-gaps when I have a larger monitor...

Now this repo have the following dotfiles and may be different from the screenshot

- zsh ( need oh-my-zsh )
- neovim
- tmux
- i3-gaps, rofi, compton ( still working I guess )
- editorconfig
- latte-dock, eclipse preferences (just backup)
- a script to make dotfiles above work ( It is not tested! )
